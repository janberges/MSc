\chapter{Multi-band results}
\label{multi-band results}

In the previous chapter it has been confirmed that \name{McMillan}'s equation
can very well be used to predict critical temperatures of local
\name{Eliashberg} theory if only one electronic band is considered. The question
remains, whether it may also be applied if the coupling strengths are matrices
rather than scalars, which is equivalent to the problem of finding single-band
systems which resemble multi-band systems with respect to the critical
temperature -- self-energies etc. will certainly differ. Having three degrees of
freedom at hand, namely the phonon frequency $\omega \sub E$, the
electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ and the \name{Coulomb} pseudo-potential
$\mu^*$, there are of course innumerable possibilities to accomplish this.
However, since an unphysical redistribution of influences shall be avoided, the
further shall not be modified and, if the latter vanishes, one is left with
determining a single parameter $\lambda$ without ambiguities. This is what the
present chapter is dedicated to, for the special case of a two-band system and
within the CDOS approximation.

To begin with, the temperature dependence of the order parameters of the
different bands is investigated in analogy to Section~\ref{temperature
dependence of order parameter}. Next, it presented how intra- and inter-band
coupling strengths can be varied independently without altering the critical
temperature. Based on this, the approximate mappings onto scalar coupling
constants proposed in Section~\ref{effective scalar coupling strengths} are
visualized using the example of inter-band coupling alone. Finally, the same
approximations are tested with respect to the critical temperature itself.

%
In the multi-band formalism a different self-energy, and thus a different energy
gap, may be associated with each band. In Fig.~\ref{incrementally switching on
inter-band coupling} the two gaps of the considered two-band systems are shown
as functions of temperature, i.e. in their role as order parameters, for
different strengths of the inter-band coupling. The latter is chosen equally
spaced on a logarithmic scale, which leads to a higher resolution on the side of
small couplings. In the upper panel both inter-band coupling strengths are
varied simultaneously, in the lower panels either of them is zero in order to
point out its specific influence. Actually the latter situations are unphysical,
since they may only be realized if either of the band densities of states, which
also enter the diagonal coupling strengths, is zero or infinite (see
Section~\ref{multi-band equations}). The diagonal elements, however, are chosen
to be finite constants which differ by a factor of two.

In the case of intra-band coupling alone, which is not displayed in
Fig.~\ref{incrementally switching on inter-band coupling}, one finds two curves
which exactly resemble those for the single-band systems corresponding to the
separate bands -- because that is what they are. Each band has its own critical
temperature; the upper one is associated with the system as a whole. Also, the
number of iterations needed to reach convergence is found to be enhanced at both
critical temperatures.

As soon as the influence of the band with the higher critical temperature on the
other band is switched on -- it is important to note that this coupling is not
bidirectional --, the end of the lower curve is extended towards the end of the
upper one resulting in a common critical temperature,%
%
\footnote{Within the BCS theory, a similar behavior has been observed by
\name{Suhl}, \name{Matthias} and \name{Walker}
\cite[Fig.~2]{SuhlMatthiasWalker59}.}
%
which retains the exact value determined by the greater intra-band coupling
strength (right panel). For this to happen, the strength of the switched-on
coupling is irrelevant and only influences the magnitude along the newly formed
tail.

In the case of a reversed influence, the upper critical temperature comes closer
to the lower one, which in turn remains constant (left panel). At the same time,
the lower curve becomes apparent in the shape of the upper one at the
corresponding temperatures, resulting in a sharp bend at the lower critical
temperature.

When both effects are combined, i.e. when the inter-band couplings are switched
on simultaneously, there is a common critical temperature which depends on the
coupling strength (upper panel). At all other non-zero temperatures both curves
are differentiable because the lower curve is softened by the way it reaches for
the end of the upper curve, the shape of which it still has influence on.

Notably, the critical temperature is not always enhanced if an element of the
electron-phonon coupling matrix increases. The possibility of an inhibiting
influence is disregarded when taking the maximum eigenvalue of the coupling
matrix as an effective scalar coupling strength, as described in
Section~\ref{non-renormalized}, since it increases monotonically as a function
of any element, just like the resulting critical temperature.

\section{Critical isotherms}

The influence of the individual elements of the electron-phonon coupling matrix
on the critical temperature requires a more detailed analysis. Making a start,
this section is dedicated to the search for \emph{different} coupling matrices
which yield the \emph{same} critical temperature, i.e. for \q{critical
isotherms} in the space of the matrix elements.

        20 \, \unit{meV}$, $\omega_N = 25 \, \omega \sub E$ and $\mu^* = 0$,
        hyperbolas are shown, along which either intra- or inter-band
        electron-phonon coupling strengths in a two-band system may be jointly
        varied without changing the critical temperature. They intersect the
        bisector of the quadrant at $\lambda \sub{d.} = \lambda_{1 1} =
        \lambda_{2 2}$ and $\lambda \sub{od.} = \lambda_{1 2} = \lambda_{2 1}$,
        respectively. It shall be noted that the matrix $\vec \lambda = \lambda
        \sub{d.} \vec \sigma_0 + \lambda \sub{od.} \vec \sigma_1$ and the scalar
        $\lambda = \lambda \sub{d.} + \lambda \sub{od.}$ yield the same critical
        temperature.}
    \label{hyperbolas of constant Tc}
\end{figure}
%
To divide the problem into manageable parts the following question is proposed:
How must either the intra- or the inter-band coupling strengths change
\emph{simultaneously}, with the respective other pair of elements held constant,
so that the corresponding critical temperature is conserved?

The outcome for some representative parameter sets is displayed in
Fig.~\ref{hyperbolas of constant Tc}. The numerical results, illustrated as
scatter plots, immediately suggest the following dependency: The matching intra-
and inter-band coupling strengths lie on convex and concave sections of
hyperbolas, respectively. This assumption is confirmed by comparison with a
guess for the analytic dependence, which will be developed subsequently.

Let $x$ represent the variable and $y$ the dependent element of the
electron-phonon coupling matrix. The most simple equation defining a hyperbola
through $x = y = \lambda$ reads
%
\begin{equation*}
    y = \frac {\lambda^2} x.
\end{equation*}
%
However, the asymptotes would coincide with the $x$- and $y$-axes which is
definitely not always the case in Fig.~\ref{hyperbolas of constant Tc}. The
hyperbola is thus compressed by the factors $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in $x$- and
$y$-direction, respectively, with $x = y = \lambda$ defining the fixed point.
This yields
%
\begin{equation*}
    y = \frac
        {\frac{\lambda^2} {\alpha (x - \lambda) + \lambda} - \lambda}
        \beta
    + \lambda
    = \frac 1 \beta \frac
        {\lambda^2 - \lambda [\alpha (x - \lambda) + \lambda]}
        {\alpha (x - \lambda) + \lambda}
    + \lambda
    = \lambda - \frac \alpha \beta \frac
        {\lambda (x - \lambda)}
        {\alpha (x - \lambda) + \lambda}
    = \lambda - \frac \alpha \beta \frac
        \lambda
        {\alpha + \frac \lambda {x - \lambda}}.
\end{equation*}
%
The new asymptotes are at $x = x_\infty = \lambda (1 - \alpha^{-1})$ and $y =
y_\infty = \lambda (1 - \beta^{-1})$. Thus
%
\begin{equation*}
    y = \lambda - \frac{\lambda - y_\infty}{\lambda - x_\infty} \frac
        \lambda
        {\frac \lambda {\lambda - x_\infty} + \frac \lambda {x - \lambda}}
    = \lambda - \frac{\lambda - y_\infty}{x - x_\infty} (x - \lambda).
\end{equation*}
%
This formula describes the desired relation between the intra-band coupling
strengths for $x_\infty$ and $y_\infty$ greater than or equal to $\lambda$. In
contrast, $x_\infty$ and $y_\infty$ less than or equal to $\lambda$ are required
for the description of the inter-band coupling. The asymptotes may also be
expressed in terms of the $x$- and $y$-intercepts $x_0$ and $y_0$:
%
\begin{align*}
    x_0 &= \lambda \Big[ 1 - \frac{\lambda - x_\infty}{y_\infty} \Big], &
    x_\infty &= \frac{\lambda^2 x_0}{\lambda (x_0 + y_0) - x_0 y_0}, \\
    y_0 &= \lambda \Big[ 1 - \frac{\lambda - y_\infty}{x_\infty} \Big], &
    y_\infty &= \frac{\lambda^2 y_0}{\lambda (x_0 + y_0) - x_0 y_0}.
\end{align*}
%
For each parameter set the asymptotes are determined numerically. For the
inter-band coupling, $x_\infty$ and $y_\infty$ are calculated directly by
assigning a very large value, $10^{10}$ say, to either $\lambda_{1 2}$ or
$\lambda_{2 1}$ and solving for the other element. In the intra-band case the
asymptotes are excluded from the domain of possible values. Hence, the
intercepts are calculated, where either $\lambda_{1 1}$ or $\lambda_{2 2}$ is
zero. The position of the asymptotes is then concluded by means of the above
equations.

The determined hyperbolas are plotted together with the numerical data points,
which reveals a very good agreement. The choice of the correct asymptotes
depends not only on $\lambda$ but also on the two matrix elements which are held
constant. If an analytic expression of these dependencies were known, a closed
set of equations would be obtained which could be solved for the scalar
equivalent of the whole coupling matrix. This task is not accomplished within
the present work, but in the following section some predictions of the proposed
approximate mappings regarding this matter are presented.

\subsection{Asymptotes for inter-band coupling}

        only exact results of the CDOS \name{Eliashberg} theory but also the
        behavior within the approximations of a cutoff-independent mapping onto
        effective scalar coupling constants (Section~\ref{cutoff-independent})
        and a renormalization of unity (Section~\ref{non-renormalized}) are
        presented. Phonon and cutoff frequency are chosen to be $\omega \sub E =
        20 \, \unit{meV}$ and $\omega_N = 15 \, \omega \sub E$, respectively.}
    \label{inter-band hyperbola of constant Tc}
\end{figure}
%
In this section the approximate mappings onto effective scalar coupling
strengths which were introduced in Section~\ref{effective scalar coupling
strengths} are visualized for the special case of inter-band coupling alone,
i.e. $\lambda_{1 1} = \lambda_{2 2} = 0$. Because of the following symmetry of
the off-diagonal elements, $\lambda_{1 2}$ as a function of $\lambda_{2 1}$ is
an involution, i.e. its own inverse. Subsequently, both asymptotes have the same
distance to their corresponding axes.

The latter is determined both numerically and analytically according to
Eqs.~\ref{non-renormalized} and \ref{cutoff-independent}. In the case studied,
the latter reduce to the hyperbola equations
%
\begin{equation*}
    \lambda = \sqrt{\lambda_{1 2} \lambda_{2 1}}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    \lambda = -\frac 1 2 \Big[ \lambda_{1 2} + \lambda_{2 1} + \sqrt{
        (\lambda_{2 1} + \lambda_{1 2})^2
        + 12 \lambda_{1 2} \lambda_{2 1}
        }
    \Big].
\end{equation*}
%
Solving for $\lambda_{2 1}$ and taking the limit $\lambda_{1 2} \rightarrow
\infty$ yields the corresponding asymptotes:
%
\begin{equation*}
    \lambda_{2 1} = \frac{\lambda^2}{\lambda_{1 2}} \rightarrow 0
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    \lambda_{2 1} = \frac{\lambda + \lambda_{1 2}}{3 \lambda_{1 2} - \lambda}
    \lambda \rightarrow \frac \lambda 3.
\end{equation*}
%
The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{inter-band hyperbola of constant Tc}. For
all values of $\lambda$, the approximation of a cutoff-independent mapping
yields better results than the assumption of a renormalization of unity.
Especially for $\lambda \approx 1$, the agreement is satisfactory; for larger
$\lambda$ it worsens continuously.

        Visualization of the quality of the introduced approximate mappings onto
        effective scalar coupling strengths. For a random sample of
        electron-phonon coupling matrices and their corresponding scalar
        couplings strengths, critical temperatures are calculated and plotted
        against each other. The temperatures corresponding to integer scalar
        coupling strengths are marked for a better orientation. The continuous
        line is the quadrant bisector. Again, $\omega \sub E = 20 \, \unit{meV}$
        and $\omega_N = 15 \, \omega \sub E$.}
    \label{quality of the effective scalar coupling strengths}
\end{figure}
%
Finally, the two mappings shall also be tested with respect to the critical
temperatures they predict. To that end a sample of 500 electron-phonon coupling
matrices is generated, the elements of which are random samples from a uniform
distribution over $[0, 1)$, preselected by the criterion that their maximum
eigenvalue is not less then $\frac 1 2$ in order to circumvent very low
temperatures which are accompanied by a high computational workload caused by
considering many \name{Matsubara} frequencies. For each matrix and their
corresponding scalar couplings strengths, critical temperatures are calculated
and plotted against each other. The resulting scatter plots are given in
Fig.~\ref{quality of the effective scalar coupling strengths}. It shall be
noted, that on average, random coupling matrices may not represent those
representing real materials very well.

The approximation of a cutoff-independent mapping turns out to be considerably
more accurate than the assumption of a renormalization of unity, in accordance
with the results of the previous section. Again, the former approach yields best
results for coupling strengths in the vicinity of unity. Below and above it
tends to under- and overestimate the critical temperature. The average absolute
error is found to be \input{results/2-band/error1.dat}\,K. Also, the statement
made at the end of Section~\ref{temperature dependence of order parameters} is
confirmed: Neglecting the renormalization does never lead to an underestimate of
the critical temperature -- on the contrary in most of the cases. Here, the
average absolute error is \input{results/2-band/error2.dat}\,K.
