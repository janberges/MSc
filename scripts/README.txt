This directory contains the Python scripts used to generate all the figures.

Note that the scripts 'order-parameter.py', 'pade.py', 'self-energy.py', and
'sidebar.py' use analytic continuation, which is numerically unstable, while
'tc.py' uses random numbers. As a consequence, it is not possible to exactly
reproduce the published figures in these cases.
