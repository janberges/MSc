This directory contains the Python scripts used to generate all the figures.

Note that the scripts 'order-parameter.py', 'pade.py', and 'sidebar.py' use
analytic continuation, which can be numerically unstable, while 'tc.py' uses
random numbers. Hence, it is not possible to exactly reproduce the published
figures in these cases.
