05  Finish chapter on Eliashberg theory:

+ Use chemical potential/grand canonical ensemble for Eliashberg theory
+ Explain where the symmetry Sigma[i omega(n)] = Sigma[-i omega(n)] comes from
- Introduce spectral representation, explain reintroduction of energy integral
+ Explain why cDOS approach requires rescaling the Coulomb interaction
- Write more about linearized Eliashberg equations:
    - Show equivalence of Rainer-Bergmann formulation of Eliashberg eigenvalue
      problem and maybe explain why it leads to a slower convergence.
- Use only one summand of Omega(omega, omega', omega") + Omega(omega, -omega',
  omega'') in integral by returning to int[-inf, +inf] domega'?
- McMillan's equation:
    + Reference Allen/Dynes with respect to rescaled and McMillan's mu*
    - McMillan, Rowell in Superconductivity, ed. by Parks: mu* from measurement?


06  Apply for PhD position.

+ Write motivation letter and curriculum vitae.
+ Send it.


07  Numerical results:

- How are self-energy and Tc calculated?


08  Non-cDOS self-energy and Tc:

- Derive square-lattice dispersion and DOS which is used as example
- How does effective lambda change with energy shift and associated change of
  the density of states? What happens for 0.001 % (two electrons) and 99.999 %
  of half-filling for square lattice?


09  Convergence tests:

- How does cutoff change normal-state Z(i omega_n) (exact analytical results)?


15  Multi-band self-energy and Tc:

- effective lambda: Show that eigenvalues of Kronecker product of matrices are
  products of eigenvalues of its factors and that the maximum eigenvalue of
  lambda determines Tc.
    - Why are the asymptotes of lambda(1,2) = lambda^2 / lambda(2,1) moved
      away from the axes according to non-linearized Eliashberg equations?
    - lambda = [[x, 1], [1, y]] yields (x - lambda)(y - lambda) = 1. Do curves
      like that reoccur for elements of muStar which does not commute with
      lambda? Analyze special cases if whole problem is too difficult?
- The eigenvalues of [1/(2m+1)]*[muStar(i,j)] are either zero or proportional to
  the eigenvalues of muStar. The eigenvectors are constant. What about the
  eigenvalues of matrix differences?


19  Fix details, preserve overall consistency:

- Introduce meaning of k, q, sigma only once
- Write time argument (0) or not?
- Decide between title and sentence case in references


20  Anomalous perturbation theory:

- Anomalous perturbation theory/spontaneous symmetry breaking:
    - Richard D. Mattuck: A Guide to Feynman Diagrams in the Many-body Problem,
      Sec. 17.4
    - Gabriele Giuliani, Giovanni Vignale: Quantum Theory of the Electron
      Liquid, Fig. 6.33


21  Introduction to superconductivity:

- Review history of superconductivity (Ginzburg-Landau?)
- Fr√∂hlich transformation correct? Divergences because of poles in S?


25  Introduction/motivation:

- McMillan may possibly fail for:
    - Multi-pocket interactions (e.g. in MgB2, MoS2)
        - Read MgB2 paper by Igor Mazin cited by Roxana Margine
    - Strong correlations (quasi particle picture still valid, see Marsiglio and
      J.P. Carbotte)
    - Fluctuations in the order parameter (magnons etc.)
- Where exactly is the zero crossing of the Matsubara gap?
    - What happens for growing mu*/lambda?
    - ... in the multiband case?


If there is time left:

- Create symbols for repeated use with TikZ?


If there is even more time left:

- Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) and Dynamical Vertex Approximation (DGA)?
