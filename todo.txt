- McMillan may possibly fail for:
    - Multi-pocket interactions (e.g. in MgB2, MoS2)
    - Strong correlations (quasi particle picture still valid, see Marsiglio and
      J.P. Carbotte)
    - Fluctuations in the order parameter (magnons etc.)

- Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) and Dynamical Vertex Approximation (DGA)?
- How does effective lambda change with energy shift and associated change of
  the density of states? What happens for 0.001 % (two electrons) and 99.999 %
  of half-filling for square lattice?

- Read MgB2 paper by Igor Mazin cited by Roxana Margine

- Where exactly is the zero crossing of the Matsubara gap?
    - What happens for growing mu*/lambda?
    - ... in the multiband case?

- effective lambda: Show that eigenvalues of Kronecker product of matrices are
  products of eigenvalues of its factors and that the maximum eigenvalue of
  lambda determines Tc.
    - Why are the asymptotes of lambda(1,2) = lambda^2 / lambda(2,1) moved
      away from the axes according to non-linearized Eliashberg equations?
    - lambda = [[x, 1], [1, y]] yields (x - lambda)(y - lambda) = 1. Do curves
      like that reoccur for elements of muStar which does not commute with
      lambda? Analyze special cases if whole problem is too difficult?

- The eigenvalues of [1/(2m+1)]*[muStar(i,j)] are either zero or proportional to
  the eigenvalues of muStar. The eigenvectors are constant. What about the
  eigenvalues of matrix differences?
- Show equivalence of Rainer-Bergmann formulation of Eliashberg eigenvalue
  problem and maybe explain why it leads to a slower convergence.
- Where does symmetry Sigma[i omega(n)] = Sigma[-i omega(n)] come from?
