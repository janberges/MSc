        I would like to thank Professor Tim Wehling for the opportunity to write
        my master's thesis in this interesting field of physics, Professor Gerd
        Czycholl for offering a second opinion, Malte Rösner, Gunnar Schönhoff
        and the whole working group for instructive discussions, Miriam Nüß for
        a final proofreading, especially my parents for continuously supporting
        my studies and finally all developers of public software and
        information.
